1. Starting from the file calculator08buggy.cpp, get the calculator to compile
2. Go through the entire program and add appropriate comments.
3. As you commented, you found errors (deviously inserted especially for you to find). Fix them; they are not in the text of
the book.

1. Allow underscores in the calculator’s variable names.
2. Provide an assignment operator, =, so that you can change the value of a variable after you introduce it using let.
Discuss why that can be useful and how it can be a source of problems.
3. Provide named constants that you really can’t change the value of. Hint: You have to add a member to Variable that
distinguishes between constants and variables and check for it in set_value(). If you want to let the user define constants
(rather than just having pi and e defined as constants), you’ll have to add a notation to let the user express that, for
example, const pi = 3.14;.
